      <p>
        My career goal is to bridge the gap between complex industrial systems and intuitive, efficient software solutions. I aim to lead the design and deployment of cutting-edge automation technologies that support human potential and enhance reliability in high-stakes environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am especially passionate about working with robotics and embedded systems that support critical processes in healthcare, aerospace, and defense. In the next five years, I plan to deepen my expertise in custom automation, contribute to transformative projects, and mentor upcoming engineers in high-integrity software design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I want to be at the forefront of innovation where software meets machinery-delivering solutions that are as resilient and adaptable as the people who use them.
